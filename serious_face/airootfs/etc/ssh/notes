ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 server_ca
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 client_ca
ssh-keygen -s server_ca -I server_ca -h -n crazy_talk -V +52w ssh_host_rsa_key.pub
HostCertificate ./ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub
./known_hosts: @cert-authority $(cat server_ca.pub) user@crazy_talk
TrustedUserCAKeys ./client_ca.pub
ssh-keygen -s client_ca -I user -n user -V +52w id_rsa.pub
still looking for a server side version of known_hosts
probably dump a much smaller client valid length and ip change check
if it thefted it only lasts a short period and if it isnt routed through the existing node it flags and revokes it...
