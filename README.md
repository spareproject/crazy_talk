so... im on a mailing list that quite literally told me you can escalate privileges by mounting corrupted filesystems...<br>
previous version literally had none root plug in any pre made usb and fuck shit up...<br>
you can still do that if you bruteforce product vendor and serial or just udevadm when the usbs plugged in as none root /shrug<br>
and theres still a million and one other ways to break this<br>
<br>
but actually stuck a real udev rule in because it was breaking to much shit<br>
