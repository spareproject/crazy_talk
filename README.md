#READMAH
random dump cant even remember whats changed making desktop <br>
need to generate the rbac rules<br>
going to gut it literally tor chromium weechat rtorrent mpv not enough packages on it to rebuild itself<br>
dumping sudo su any form of access to root in theory haha<br>
probably going to blag more apparmor style rbac for the binaries<br>
if it doesnt auto magic on boot then well your pretty fucked mode currently has sudo to debug and setup<br>
i do get the irony in calling this a desktop but it is one deal with it<br>
<br>
then minimals going container / lan / cluster / any play insecure update whore mode can generate usbs<br>
desktops a browser with other things i use steam style ie as few moving parts as possible<br>
<br>
really need to do a template and tidy up the build.sh / install.sh / pacman.conf / gnupg.sh / then the bootloader / udev rules <br>
to make a minimal template its either pacstrap base with bootctl and syslinux to literally zero config<br>
or the above and gnupg plug and play pretty much adding gnupg to the template <br>
cant really decide but ill make a template clean the scripts and config till i stop twitching at how unorganized this is <br>
then its done bar random backups for stuff im running on it... but dumping a template would be a decent stable checkpoint to say this is done and a semi usable thing /shrug<br>

im suprised i remembered anything about grsec setups may have been awhile and the configs literally learning on a few binaries and whatever i need to butcher to make it passwordless liveusb friendly
so dont expect anything special probably attempting to do to many things at once<br>
<br>
template<br>
minimal<br>
desktop<br>
container<br>
steam<br>

i wouldnt use the binaries im dumping in airootfs/root/packages build them...<br>
gutted some stuff out of weechat<br>
dwm larger font no default rules i said ages ago everythings green on black because wasting time on colorschemes is pointless but less edit easier maintain from pull<br>
<br>
pepperflash <- erm yeh this doesnt work for shit google music play lasts about 2 minutes before the entire browser crashes<br>
everytime i go to bbc iplayer on a chromebook i get free system updates :D everyime i go on archiso it bricks the iso...<br>
^ seriously you can manipulate the legal system so its legal for a handfull of people to be a bunch of cunts on the internet but illegal for everyone else to... dat logic tho
