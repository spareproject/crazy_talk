this thing is pretty horrible to say the least<br>
i honestly blame openssl for the amount of bloat and half implemented crap its left just gives me a headache<br>
<br>
havent actually done anything literally nothing<br>
but 2 weeks later and nothings actually broken...<br>
<br>
longest ive ever been able to go ./build.sh and not have to change anything... : /<br>
somethings up to quiet <br>
<br>
chromium has to be the singular crappest thing i have installed at the minute scrolling down in nspawn sshx hits 25% cpu... <br>
and sounds like a fucking jet taking off grats stock heat sink youre pro<br>
<br>
if i can get default homepage in surf to a list of bookmarks then chattr +i/-i for allow cookies when your logging in im pretty much done<br>
^ first install ive ever had under 1G wuth a desktop and browser... chromium is half a gig of deps on arch...<br>
either that or midori<br>
i still a want browser that just outright doesnt support javascript its shit dont use it<br>
<br>
so turns out i only ever do anything when something breaks... its in a crap state but works and if i poke it again it will break<br>
