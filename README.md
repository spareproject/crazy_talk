general tidy up i think atleast<br>
<br>
desktop - firstboot, should probably just drop sshd on desktop i dont have any reason to ssh into it<br>
but firstboot and oneshot work on desktop even with the extra bloat and unused keys it generates /shrug<br>
so desktop gets oneshot to load gnupg minimal gets all the things<br>
<br>
two identical monitors next to each other same settings both display the dark gray st term color differently so i have no idea how it actually looks /shrug<br>
<br>
going to finish basic webserver stuff...<br>
<br>
been looking at busybox and minirc might sly the boot directory currently used and play with that for a bit still want outright boot to initcpio shell<br>
<br>
openssl and gnupg both do root signing key<br>
openssh... on the other hand doesnt<br>
openssl gets a pass (still hate it)<br>
openssh is getting prodded with sticks till it does something<br>
<br>
still cant systemd-nspawn or pacman... yey working things and stable stuff<br>
if pacman didnt shit the bed i probably wouldnt have stopped depending on pkgbuilds so break more things and i might learn more (but will go kicking and screaming)<br>
<br>
