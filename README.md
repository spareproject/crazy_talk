#READMAH

erm no more xterm no more weechat<br>
lots of random binary dumps that i didnt even bother to check hashes for nevermind keys etc etc<br>
i prefer the idea of dumping stuff that points to someone elses managed worried about signed off stuff<br>
so its generally becoming less of something i can justify hosting on github i doubt i could secure this account never mind binary blobs<br>
but its still a free offsite backup... <br>
