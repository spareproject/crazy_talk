#READMAH
didnt look it at for two days now its all fucked... much stable<br>
cant su - user on a chroot or systemd-nspawn so none of the ssh works in nspawn literally didnt change anything<br>
make package worked now it doesnt do shit<br>
i really want to do hasscicam if that actually works its going everywhere haha i may even untape my webcams : /<br>
^ someone needs to compile that for me because makepkg wont work for shit and its really pissing me off and everything to get none root on internal storage doesnt work either<br>
fucking raging<br>
going shiny button idiot mode on minimal (idiot mode being the http localhost execute whatever you want as root mode... and its going to be that way for awhile<br>
as in at some point this is going on lan facing with lulz remote execute with zreo attempt at stopping it<br>
but i want ot work on snapshot mode where logging into a server can trigger a lan scan and pretty much dump that node as a header node based on timestamping the last snapshot of the current network<br>
^ that probably doesnt make sense<br>

thinking of it in terms of 3 million phones online creating a centralized point is fail... but allowing distributed remote querying means there is no centralized dump<br>
you can still get a shit load of inforamtion by performing queries in real time vs storing information and querying it<br>
but needs loads of stuff to stop dos etc meh rambling<br>

should probably drop proxy tor for openvpn or something i can blag lan over wan with<br>
using lighttpd over nginx which hurts my epeen because i actually read all the nginx docs module for module compiled all the stuff i didnt use out learnt stuff<br>
but its a total fuck on for lan shiny button press to bash scripts<br>
every other boot randomly drops systemd-networkd as in nothing starts and the only error notes are something about timeout so /shrug<br>
but if it ever does work again last time it was fucked for literally a month theyll atleast be a shiny easy to use mode<br>
<br>

so overall the entire things currently f00ked please try again later<br>
