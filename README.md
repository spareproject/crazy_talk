right... <br>
<br>
either ignore the blatent fails and push wan<br>
flavour of the week website...<br>
has account setup / profile<br>
read write between accounts<br>
avatards and the ability to dump images<br>
^ totally going to rape whatever api they have and abuse bandwidth<br>
pretty much the same as the raid 5 how much bandwidth and storage can you steal mode<br>
<br>
probably actually need the o shit mode raid5 split dump crypted...<br>
<br>
basically X Y Z.... x is the main tmp keyset website / c&c hijack y - internal backup, z o shit mode<br>
x list - sites with scripts for tmp layer... y list - sites with scripts for internal cluster network, z - o shit mode root key persistents dead<br>
<br>
^ need to find a way to get a physical data dump... ie trigger some automated site i can buy things from to actually get a physical object delivered to a dead drop<br>
^ already got ideas for that - would be o shit mode - push hard regen of persistent and hope anything still up closes with new key and sits idle<br>
<br>
^ if i ever dump something that twerks itll probably be changed within a week so lulz<br>
basically it wont be that hard but maintaining scripts to abuse fotw site for c&c is a full time job<br>
<br>
account would be an internal keyset / remote wan point<br>
either storing containers in photos, random posts etc or create master slave account and blag friend adds...<br>
^ friend adds dont work for forums but then uptime would be sketckhy as fuck literally some crap chat bot with crypted sig+avatard<br>
and would need months worth of uptime testing<br>
depends on whats up but theres enough sites with slack security to do whatever the fuck you want really<br>
<br>
but containers as auth into a profile/account or creating a new account... would be internal/container equivilent<br>
to talk to a container or make requests... would still need a internal trigger to actually allow that as a share... however that list is hosted<br>
<br>
^ forum post from cluster X wants container clust Y returns <br>
<br>
forums could be pretty usefull depending on how sigs are read... if it lets you leave old sigs up you get a lot of functionality if its dumped from db based on reading poster then meh<br>
<br>
basically same setup just dumping on random sites to enable wan - probably safer than netcat all the things...<br>
and free storage and bandwidth is free and theres gigabytes of it everywhere<br>
<br>
<br>
or tidy everything up without any form of wan...<br>
ive already done the grunt work theory for starting a botnet to use as a random proxy chain tor style<br>
need a test case 100 random nodes week idle traffic sniff then dump an algo that can grab intersects and create routing tables<br>
so what next...<br>
<br>
actual test environment...<br>
30 containers...<br>
  3 host key sets<br>
  15 - host one, 7 - host two, 8 - host three<br>
  theory nodes are hardware holding a signed internal keyset<br>
  then how ever many containers they can actually get up... : / moar hardware!<br>
<br>
blagging wan would involve finding someone sucky enough to let me email support with o but i have like 90 brothers that all play the same video game to...<br>
or see how long i get to spam accounts and test uptime for literal binary dumps <br>
<br>
/shrug<br>
<br>
still just the same 3 hop logic dumped at scale<br>
<br>
wan gnupg pki or... literally have no other ideas than sucky script clean up<br>
<br>
<br>
