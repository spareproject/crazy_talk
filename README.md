so ninja update desktop and go away for 5 days...<br>
desktop config totally fucked...<br>
there's still massive issues in and around signing tmp keys ive yet to even<br>
pretty much leaves kek easy stealth persistent mitm... <br>
but nooooo<br>
<br>
did have a working version updated it<br>
if you pull the usb out it freezes the entire system literally zero response?<br>
<br>
but either way<br>
you need to be hosting your own cache of tmp keys (assumes key exchange is always new)<br>
signing them with a valid to - from timestamp<br>
exchange a otp and only use signs that follow on from a pre shared secret etc...<br>
but its current state is beyond useless till you implement some form of screening new keys<br>
<br>
^ probably involves your own infrastructure <br>
same with key revoke <br>
<br>
hence why i havent touched it yet<br>
<br>
but on the off chance someone finds this and things o shiny its really not<br>
<br>
but QQ at fucked usb : / <br>
<br>
someone grabs a tmp key signed by your key... can insert that into every transaction and middle man you<br>
quickest fix would be to add a timestamp to the sign on it from your persistent key<br>
<br>
^ ive been working on none time caring exchanges but need an actual network example / test case set up to use it<br>
loads of ideas theres a million and one ways to exchange without time as a factor... but then pros cons need to find the best implement for the networking im trying to setup <br>
