<br>

pfft i suck<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
havent tested any of it yet dont know how to setup openssh to seperate host,internal and container<br>
probably doesnt work and sketchy to execute anything<br>
<br>
i want a nfc read writer ages ago but realistaclly there a bit meh read alot of stuff about increasing the range they respond to<br>
so for unhashed random keys there not really all that stealth never checked the validity but did see alot of doorframe picks and other bottlenecks<br>
that can ping and listen<br>
<br>
was thinking about building point to point mesh network<br>
and the total fuck ups of programming for an efficient network combined with moving nodes<br>
any node inbetween only two headers overlap - all nodes would be given the same channels by both towers for full crypted becon bacon <br>
based on its load <br>
did look at drone clusters with raspi + wifi or usb to radio and have seen f@h for distributed upload of sets of data, ai + number of available human i/o interface<br>
vs computer only interfaces<br>
<br>
just wanted a cluster with eth lan for error checking radio but 4 usb ports split with ethernet cpu bus... wifi bluetooth (rtl_sdr + antenna) (gps exact no antenna) <br>
still got 2 hackrfs <br>
^ wanted faraday cage to play with radio... <br>
