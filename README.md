this things pretty ugly should probably sort out all the boot foo in /root because why is it even there to begin with... /shrug<br>
<br>
udev rule doesnt work on boot it spams the shit out of everything... bash_profile dump temp fix but getting sick of unplug plug to run firstboot<br>
<br>
steams now tiny... but is 1.5G < - how?<br>
wanted to merge a desktop and steam hit 2.7GB and it wouldnt even boot so literally as few files as needed to get it to actually boot and run steam with catalyst...<br>
need a script for audio card /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf defaults... <br>
mount internal storage onto /home/user/.local/share/Steam... < - steam hijacks pacman in terms of monitoring installed files and its less moving parts <br>
<br>
still fixing stuff in minimal<br>
going to push a pretty dirty lan discovery but need to fix container ssh certs and maybe cert by cluster<br>
and make a decent installer<br>
<br>
need a fallback stick with a browser on it + general stuff probably go grsec, chromium actually config rbac, tty1 user tty2 bob<br>
forwarding all of bobs tcp traffic through a tor transport and udp requests through tordns<br>
^ maybe focus sucky throw up scripts to manage persistent gnupg key so i can buy shit loads of drugs throught the internetz <br> 
should probably stop talking shit and treat this seriously because internets is serious buisness <br>

but generally falling to bits and held together with duct tape
