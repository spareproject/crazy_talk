nspawn worked for an entire glorious two minutes then the entire iso hard bricked itself<br>
all i ever wanted to do was have a decent test environment for botnet software : /<br>
^ ive been saying that shit for over 2 years now and im pretty sure this would be the 3rd time ive scripted stuff to quick boot nspawn... dejavu much<br>
<br>
firstboot - needs to be able to run twice<br>
the last time i tried to script unionfs it blew up stupidly fast...<br>
has a stupid knock on effect for every other script<br>
but it makes playing with rootfs building isos everything i find fun easier... <br>
^ can literally squashfs any container dump it the boot partition and edit the bootloader to point to it<br>
pretty sure i should probably be making a boot only script and split rootfs generation combine liveusb/container dirs into one...<br>
<br>
only uploading because the little green and yellow boxes make me feel like im being productive ^_^<br>
