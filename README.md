and sleep... if it doesnt work again tomorrow im going baby seal clubbing<br>
i actually tested everything in it twice so fuck you<br>

^ make tested everything in it twice atleast 6 new bootable usbs from clean<br>
then decides to die, not mount propperly and bitch about immutable on syslinux epic<br>
didnt edit shit just decided it didnt want to work for 10 minutes and now magically does again<br>
one word stable<br>
3 words stable as f00k<br>

havent really updated anything its a total mess<br>
probably need container cluster based server/client certs<br>

probably not upload anything for awhile going easy boot multiple nodes persistent install in a container <br>
still couldnt get usb passthrough to work makes loading gnupg messages a bit of a pain<br>
but cant upload anything to github easily and have enough copies spread over usbs to not really need a backup the ssd can die and im only loosing last update<br>

someone seems to be killing all the forums i like to read... not impressed
