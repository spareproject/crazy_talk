need a way to chattr +i ~/.surf/cookies.txt... then toggle button allow the cookies / kill the cookies...<br>
<br>
<br>
erm push because im afk probaly the most stable thing on the planet as always...<br>
<br>
no puters for 5 days and i already have withdrawl : / <br>
<br>
should be fun<br>
<br>
tarball dumped itself into itself so it builds with itself in itself...<br>
just incase best thing about usbs i have loads of them : /<br>
<br>
probably fix default web login with auth that actually uses the usb key idea <br>
bash is teh bestest language for teh web develz... obviously<br>
its default debug checking and a piss easy use case for a secure login using that as a key thing /shrug<br>
<br>
then going to look at pxe booting a container image... hard coding the path to container build scripts and 'images'<br>
<br>
its pretty much just a script to build a usb... script to build an image that has keys that work with the usb...<br>
<br>
if pxe takes a raw blob then its rebuild on every first boot with key intergration for whatever services i end up dumping on it<br>
^ usb needs to be tiny container images can have all the bloat complex crap etc <br>
so lightweight... < - liez caugh fucking huge caugh default image<br>
with a load of scripts for whatever i want to test at home... <br>
<br>
but generate the image with some netcat foo to exchange keys... and force build all images with key intergration<br>
<br>
should give me something to do anyway : /<br>
<br>
want to play with radio again but the usb size literally eats my laptop : /<br>
