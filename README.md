#READMAH
<br>
i have zero cares about how the webserver looks untill all the functionality is implemented ive literally wasted weeks of my life making fibonacci scaling css divs and other pixel perfect crap thats totally irrelivent functionality / backend then paint in unicorn farts and pixie dust<br>
<br>
o and the hardcoded path in keys.sh is all thanks to openssl basically if it isnt /mnt/storage/liveusb/mount/openssl/root.key it wont run /shrug<br>
<br>
keys.sh doesnt umount properly i cant double pkill gpg-agent it takes out the first one then hangs a proccess in the dir it trys to umount : /<br>
<br>
build.sh /dev/sdXYZ airootfs/config < - swapped it /shrug who knows<br>
<br>
i really cant express in words the deep seething hatered i feel towards ssl<br>
ive been trying to find and read docs on it for atleast two days now<br>
and i can safely say i have no idea what im doing<br>
<br>
i cant find anything saying that ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 is broken and doesnt work<br>
chromium and firefox both let me select weaker shit and inform me of its obso1337ness<br>
but neither of them accept that one... illuminati confirmed<br>
but seriously this bored line works surf and curl love it and i wouldnt complain if i never have to see openssl agiain<br>
its shat all over my minimalistic easy to undestand and explain layout<br>
maybe ive been awake to long : /<br>
<br>
was going to look at client side certificates till i remember how easy to use gnupg is and how horribly bad openssl is<br>
<br>
everythings going lan facing im dumping a lan scanner and some attempt at wireframe for network discovery (lan only)<br>
<br>
still cant systemd-nspawn or pacman systemd-networkd barely even boots so yey working things and stable stuff<br>
<br>
probably fix and tidy desktop before doing anything else on minimal<br>
<br>
minimal probably doesnt run as none root... need to check uid/gid and that mounting lets the user dir dive with user,noauto in fstab<br>
<br>
./random.sh hangs at the end for unmount sometimes had to hard kill the process first time<br>
<br>
turning into a random list of things that dont work ill probably never read<br>
<br>
erm no more xterm no more weechat<br>
lots of random binary dumps that i didnt even bother to check hashes for nevermind keys etc etc<br>
i prefer the idea of dumping stuff that points to someone elses managed worried about signed off stuff<br>
so its generally becoming less of something i can justify hosting on github i doubt i could secure this account never mind binary blobs<br>
but its still a free offsite backup... <br>
