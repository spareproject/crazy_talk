#READMAH
<br>
went a week without a phone its pretty good... haz plan<br>
<br>
random dump of website foo no where near finished no where near usable <br>
pretty much only setup the login / 2fa and 2fa for account settings<br>
<br>
going to make tables for messaging <br>
profile with public facing public key - filter by account<br>
none account username+private public key to leave a message<br>
<br>
meh just playing really<br>
<br>
general plan is use figlet for captcha till some unlucky fool has to write a ascii text to text generator<br>
then dump random font generation in it... just a little nudge<br>
then once someones well and truely wasted a large portion of their life<br>
dump it to only pull words over 5 characters and random sub two chars with ?? only take missing input<br>
and after all that<br>
switch to css generated images, thats how nice i am as a person <br>
its pretty much a stub but it does get points for being ascii art and i totally stole it from dhl haha<br>
<br>
grsecs still totally forked i literally get nothing but missing os on boot regardless of boot format<br>
<br>
read somewhere of actual use cases of sqlite databases hitting 500k read writes a day...<br>
current setup that would literally be maybe about 5 calls per page click : /<br>
but im going to bloat the shit out of it till i have wireframe / functionality down<br>
then maybe look at shrinking it tidy it and leave a template<br>
<br>
everyone kept poking at email servers for ages but im that paranoid the only time i here people say this i just go weh?<br>
going to the same spot everyweek is the equivilent of sticking a giant sign up saying super secret meeting place and expecting no one blow you up<br>
<br>
if you have forward secrecy it isnt hard to otp a new place to leave a message on every exchange<br>
ie google forum go to the one of 1,000,000 million forums out there<br>
dump a profile and hello world in introduce yourself<br>
hide the message and next X number of spots for redundency etc<br>
could script that shit with my eyes closed <br>
<br>
maybe i need to get out more : /<br>
<br>
basically desktops borked<br>
minimal still works /shrug<br>
<br>
havent added or improved anything in minimal for a while and it is literally held together with duct tape <br>
<br>
if i improve it itll probably go down i loose access to all the crap i have setup cant do anything that isnt iso get bored easily etc<br>
but meh need to finish and improve so much crap on it<br>
<br>
erm...<br>
systemd-nspawn random bug me thinks<br>
if i call machinectl login machine, then attempt to login it doesnt work at all : /<br>
if i systemd-nspawn -bD ./ and login it works perfectly<br>
dont really have a usecase to even notice this anymore but its definitly fucked<br>
<br>
