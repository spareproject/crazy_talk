was actually defeated by sleep started login mech was brain dead before i finished<br>
split the webserver into two parts...<br>
liveusb webserver - follows the overall direction of all the authentication methods have the usb persistent keys get access<br>
single user god mode<br>
<br>
spliiting webserver and stripping everything that isnt a login / authentication method and might make a full on secure platform<br>
it really isnt hard but given how long that took me to debug and actually get working its not fun it would probably be actual work<br>
or atleast how quick i threw that up vs the amount of extra features a full on multi user system needs would be atleast a week if not a month for debug / clean up<br>
<br>
the lighttpd webserver is total throw up was defeated by sleep and nearly defeated by the need for food but i literally just threw code at it and took whatever stuck<br>
in as short a time as possible<br>
<br>
needs proof reading general clean up remove duplicates make it read what its doing easily etc etc...<br>
<br>
if you cant explain the idea then it really isnt that clever<br>
<br>
literally nothing else done... and systemd is still sketchy hit or miss as to what it actually feels like starting on boot<br>
still cant container anything but dont really containers anyway<br>
the only reason i wanted container boot was because i got to play with actual nodes to make network protocols and botnet theory<br>
can do it anyway with a database backend /shrug<br>
<br>
but some actual containers would be nice so time to go QQ at the search bar till it fixes everything for me<br>
