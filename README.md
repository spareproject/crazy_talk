either implement your own key revoke network and fix tmp key checks<br>
or quick fix add a timestamp from to on every tmp key public sig<br>
<br>
^ never mentioned that once... so probably a bit meh<br>
<br>
im waiting till i a have a network up and b looking for key exchange mechs that dont require timestamping...<br>
theres loads pretty situational require an actual network up i still dont even have a key revoke dns <br>
<br>
but grsec went all o you want to pull the usb out? have some kernel panic<br>
tried deleting root= from kernel command line dropping into recovery and manually starting<br>
nothing mounted usb clearly not in use poof no more puter lines and lines of kernel panic<br>
<br>
so heres the last working grsec i had<br>
personally i love installing old software expicially when it gets the point you can<br>
literally google <package> <version> security vulnerabilities and get a nice shiny list of ways to to own someone<br>
i mean everythings updated for a reason but torrents, drugs and porn /shrug <br>
<br>
<br>
^^ literally have no idea how to even start debugging that only way to trigger it is to pull it out<br>
if its on a tty its spews kernel panic if its on X it just freezes meh<br>
