machinectl login rootfs... actually twerks<br>
^ chroot, passwd root, machinectl login rootfs, only way to grab ip address<br>
i cant for the life of me get systemd-resolved to work<br>
it refuses to cache anything llmnr lldp even with iptables flush<br>
but the cache doesnt even work? tried with and without dnscrypt-proxy<br>

<br>
definitly slowing down on this for awhile<br>
