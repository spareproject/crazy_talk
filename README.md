was looking at a two pair set of Â£20 ham radios 10 hour battery 5 mile radius does rx/tx over an audio jack<br>
i managed to get a raspi and 20,000 mah battery for about 50 quid, wifi dongle for about 3 quid<br>
would need to gut the radios and make a directional antenna or cell towers can probably get a fixed location<br>
phones / wifi routers if networked could probably be used for signal origin was 440mhz-460mhz range<br>
not that im paranoid at all<br>
drone + roof means no cctv cams<br>
