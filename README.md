did some crazy things over the weekend... reverted them all back : /<br>
tried dumping usb/container together its just pretty sucky<br>
theres no clean way to force syslinux and systemd update to run syslinu-install_update -i or bootctl install<br>
itll either be one update behind everything made (did cause bricked usb when mixing files)<br>
<br>
would care but this entire things messy more stub holders for what i would want without any investment<br>
^ still dont trust this will even run within a week moar stable plox<br>
<br>
its totally entering the relms of not even safe to boot going to start opening ports testing things meh<br>
ive always tried to pull as close to arch possible with how i would run it but its full on my own crazy world now<br>
netcat doesnt work at all im either going to have to learn socket programming in c to define the same throw up ports types i want or get used to nothing working<br>
but meh<br>
<br>
if it starts feeling complete ie i have all the functionality i need to quick boot and play with stuff then will tidy it up condense duplicate code<br>
ie put some actual work into it<br>
<br>
nearly dumped qemu back on... still want kernel compile + testing without reboot but scope etc <br>
<br>
dumped gnome-shell on it wasnt really impressed i only really terminal or a browser anymore<br>
^ and the ram limitations are shit i cant radio anymore on my laptop without epic bloat and eventual none boot<br>
<br>
tried booting a raspi with arch on... dumped some tft monitor on it and p00f its bricked as f00k<br>
^ did boot reflashed it and nothing /shrug basically picam and hasciicam lighttpd page + need a music box and film stream<br>
might be a lie wrong router...<br>
<br>
but for testing and starting network i need static ip + inexpensive 24/7 (im unplugging the internal router from the internet at night go fork yourself)<br>
to pin a header node or atleast thats the plan<br>
basically insecure as f00k<br>
<br>
everyone needs a 7 day weekend<br>
even when im not trying to work and generally just doing shit loads of drugs i still sit and stare at this thing thinking wtf am i even doing<br>
<br>
