#READMAH
everytime ive ever done work on automating this its broken within a week<br>
so im still investing few to zero fucks in it<br>
and may upload 3 lines of code every 24 hours...<br>
theres many random container names that will break scripts but there all stupid names that are totally illogical<br>
so if you complain about it you must be pretty special <br>
<br>
havent actually tested any of this... just randomly checking and editing things<br>
its all pretty terrabad... <br>
<br>
should probably be merging container and liveusb directories... < - thats a lot of work and if it ends up looking more complex than it is its not happening<br>
