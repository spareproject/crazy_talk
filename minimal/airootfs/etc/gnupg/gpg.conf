# Common options for keyserver functions:
#
# include-disabled = when searching, include keys marked as "disabled"
#                    on the keyserver (not all keyservers support this).
#
# no-include-revoked = when searching, do not include keys marked as
#                      "revoked" on the keyserver.
#
# verbose = show more information as the keys are fetched.
#           Can be used more than once to increase the amount
#           of information shown.
#
# use-temp-files = use temporary files instead of a pipe to talk to the
#                  keyserver.  Some platforms (Win32 for one) always
#                  have this on.
#
# keep-temp-files = do not delete temporary files after using them
#                   (really only useful for debugging)
#
# honor-http-proxy = if the keyserver uses HTTP, honor the http_proxy
#                    environment variable
#
# broken-http-proxy = try to work around a buggy HTTP proxy
#
# auto-key-retrieve = automatically fetch keys as needed from the keyserver
#                     when verifying signatures or when importing keys that
#                     have been revoked by a revocation key that is not
#                     present on the keyring.
#
# no-include-attributes = do not include attribute IDs (aka "photo IDs")
#                         when sending keys to the keyserver.

#keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve

# Uncomment this line to display photo user IDs in key listings and
# when a signature from a key with a photo is verified.

#show-photos

# Use this program to display photo user IDs
#
# %i is expanded to a temporary file that contains the photo.
# %I is the same as %i, but the file isn't deleted afterwards by GnuPG.
# %k is expanded to the key ID of the key.
# %K is expanded to the long OpenPGP key ID of the key.
# %t is expanded to the extension of the image (e.g. "jpg").
# %T is expanded to the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg").
# %f is expanded to the fingerprint of the key.
# %% is %, of course.
#
# If %i or %I are not present, then the photo is supplied to the
# viewer on standard input.  If your platform supports it, standard
# input is the best way to do this as it avoids the time and effort in
# generating and then cleaning up a secure temp file.
#
# The default program is "xloadimage -fork -quiet -title 'KeyID 0x%k' stdin"
# On Mac OS X and Windows, the default is to use your regular JPEG image
# viewer.
#
# Some other viewers:
# photo-viewer "qiv %i"
# photo-viewer "ee %i"
# photo-viewer "display -title 'KeyID 0x%k'"
#
# This one saves a copy of the photo ID in your home directory:
# photo-viewer "cat > ~/photoid-for-key-%k.%t"
#
# Use your MIME handler to view photos:
# photo-viewer "metamail -q -d -b -c %T -s 'KeyID 0x%k' -f GnuPG"
