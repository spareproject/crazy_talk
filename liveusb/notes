right huge queue of shit to do...
makepkg doesnt work for shit still and im not doing it manually

dwm - change tags, add surf rule, change terminal
surf - change cafile = /home/user/lighttpd/certs/, strict ssl refuse untrusted, default features plugins,scripts,inspector,geolocation = FALSE
^^ cookiefile = /home/user/lighttpd/cookiez.txt cookiepolicies = @, showindicators=false 
needs to start in the download directory easiest way and im linking it to home so
^ if lighttpd gets hosted on cluster may need to host keys download dumps them into the lighttpd dir (its all the same shit so far no external internets in theory)
basically should handle that shit now 
curl needs to be edited to point to the cert file.... ie the actual call to curl used in download
^ i need to setup my own signing cert in /dev/keys...
random gen a ssl key / cert on boot and sign it 
lighttpd wont start then without firstboot... not exactly the easiest way
basically a total fuck on 
ssh i dont use that often 
well lies same shit 
boot pull and plug because udev is shit
set the time you want the box up for... 
^ need to be able to handle re up... ie sign it again and force overwrite to avoid prompts

edit curl
--cacert /home/user/lighttpd/cert
 
total fuck on seriously hope it all dies a horrible fiery death 

same plan....

usb keys dir

gnupg root sign
gnupg persistent default

ssl root sign
ssl persistent default

realistically taking the root keys off the usb and leaving only the persistent signing ones 
ie leave them in revokable format
